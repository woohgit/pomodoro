# Pomodoro

The purpose of this serverless web application is to provide a strict pomodoro interface.

## What is it?

This is an app for **The Pomodoro Technique&reg;**. It tries to strictly follow the rules of the pomodoro.


## What is it not?
This is NOT a GTD replacement tool. You should still keep everything in your GTD tool like:

* Evernote | [https://evernote.com](https://evernote.com)
* Wunderlist | [https://www.wunderlist.com/](https://www.wunderlist.com/)
* Things2 | [https://culturedcode.com/things/](https://culturedcode.com/things/)
* Todoist | [https://todoist.com](https://todoist.com)

This app uses only your browser's local storage, so it won't be able to sync tasks between your devices. Pomodoro helps you to focus on your tasks. Every morning you should collect a few tasks from your GTD system you want to accomplish today and start working on them.
